# Voice-Clone-Model-

This repository is an implementation of Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. This was my master's thesis.

SV2TTS is a deep learning framework in three stages. In the first stage, one creates a digital representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio. In the second and third stages, this representation is used as reference to generate speech given arbitrary text.

Setup
1. Install Requirements
Both Windows and Linux are supported. A GPU is recommended for training and for inference speed, but is not mandatory.
Python 3.7 is recommended. Python 3.5 or greater should work, but you'll probably have to tweak the dependencies' versions. I recommend setting up a virtual environment using venv, but this is optional.
Install ffmpeg. This is necessary for reading audio files.
Install PyTorch. Pick the latest stable version, your operating system, your package manager (pip by default) and finally pick any of the proposed CUDA versions if you have a GPU, otherwise pick CPU. Run the given command.
Install the remaining requirements with pip install -r requirements.txt
2. (Optional) Download Pretrained Models
Pretrained models are now downloaded automatically. If this doesn't work for you, you can manually download them here.

3. (Optional) Test Configuration
Before you download any dataset, you can begin by testing your configuration with:

python demo_cli.py

If all tests pass, you're good to go.

4. (Optional) Download Datasets
For playing with the toolbox alone, I only recommend downloading LibriSpeech/train-clean-100. Extract the contents as <datasets_root>/LibriSpeech/train-clean-100 where <datasets_root> is a directory of your choosing. Other datasets are supported in the toolbox, see here. You're free not to download any dataset, but then you will need your own data as audio files or you will have to record it with the toolbox.

5. Launch the Toolbox
You can then try the toolbox:

python demo_toolbox.py -d <datasets_root>
or
python demo_toolbox.py
